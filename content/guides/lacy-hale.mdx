# A study guide: Lacy Hale
**Lacy Hale** is an artist who was born and raised in the mountains of southeastern Kentucky before following her dreams of doing art professionally to a change of scenery at the Pratt Institute of Art in Brooklyn, New York. However, she returned home to her roots to continue her artistic career, with her works being shown in both the northern and southern regions. 
She has received many recognitions for her works, including being included Appalachian artist of the year in 2021 and 2022. Her 2017 slogan and mural, No Hate in My Holler is particularly profound and has generated thousands of dollars for nonprofits, as she donates 25% of the piece’s proceeds. There is also a heat-map that shows visually how the piece has circulated across the world, which can be viewed [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20250722173654/https://www.facebook.com/artbylacyhale/videos/1887913148339182/).
