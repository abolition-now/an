# A study guide: Jakeli Swimmer
**Jakeli Swimmer** comes from a family of traditional potters, where he was inspired by his brother Luke Swimmer to begin drawing.  Primarily working with a combination of pen and ink, and digital graphic software, Swimmer draws cartoon illustrations to show changes in how native imagery is perceived. 
Using observations and conversations from personal and everyday life on the Boundary, Jakeli is able to bring a more personal touch to his artform.  Mr. Swimmer feels his approach to his art allows room for interpretations and expressions that in turn bring needed dialogue, critical thought, acknowledgement, and at times most importantly, laughter. 
Not only has Jakeli won awards at the Cherokee Indian Fair and the Kananesgi Art Competition, he also is the illustrator for the Cherokee One Feather.
