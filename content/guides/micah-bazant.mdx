# A study guide: Micah Bazant 
**Micah Bazant** is a visual artist and cultural organizer who works with liberation movements to reimagine the world. They create art inspired by struggles to end white supremacy, patriarchy, ableism, and transphobia.

Some projects they are especially proud of include their 1999 zine Timtum, the Trans Day of Resilience art project, the Trans Life + Liberation Art Series, and Miklat Miklat. They have collaborated with hundreds of organizations including Forward Together, Interrupting Criminalization, Project NIA, Sins Invalid, the Movement for Black Lives, Movement Generation, Climate Justice Alliance, Jewish Voice for Peace, Arab Resource and Organizing Center,  Sex Worker Organizing Project, Intersex Justice Project, Ella Baker Center, AgitArte, Familia Trans Queer Liberation Movement, and many more. Bazant’s work has been featured in films and publications including Trap Door, Invisible No More, Newsweek, Rebellious Mourning, The Personal Things, MAJOR! and Free CeCe.
