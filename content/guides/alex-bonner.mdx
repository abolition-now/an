# A study guide: Alex Bonner
**Alex Bonner** was the illustrator and designer for the former Mergoat Magazine. Their illustration work is featured in two issues of the magazine: Issue Number 1-Hillbilly Ecologies After the Apocalypse and Number 2-Blue Hollers in the Shadow of the Holocene. In the second Issue, the Crimethinc timeline features minimalist and striking drawings that represent acts of resistance, such as the Treesits and damaged construction equipment. The juxtaposition of the construction equipment, imposing and mechanical, with the gazebo full of panicked protestors, is incredibly moving. Bonner also made art for the Progressive Student Alliance at the University of Tennessee.
