# A study guide: DeLesslin “Roo” George-Warren

DeLesslin “Roo” George-Warren is a queer artist, researcher, and organizer from Catawba Indian Nation
whose work ranges from performance to installation art to community education to food sovereignty to
language revitalization. Since 2017 he has been the Special Projects Coordinator for the Catawba
Cultural Preservation Project where he facilitates the Catawba Language Project, several food
sovereignty initiatives, and other community education projects. The “strands” of their practice come
together in yękαpįsαwačαre, “which implies both making art and helping someone else develop skills.”
DeLesslin’s longest ongoing project has been his Indigenous Corps of Discovery tours, which present
unsettling tours of collections and museums, bringing to the forefront stories of indigenous peoples,
colonization, and survivance. Alongside offering performances, lectures, and exhibits throughout the US,
Roo has received multiple recognitions including “40 Under 40” by the National Council on American
Indian Enterprise Development, a “25 Under 25” by United National Inter Tribal Youth, and selection as a
Dreamstarter by Running Strong for American Indian Youth.

## Quote

“In Catawba we don’t have a word for “artist” that is separate from other responsibilities, like teaching, so I’ve always seen my work as an artist as a means to cultivating consciousness, resilient communities, and a more beautiful future.” (Eyebeam)
