# A study guide: Marjani Abdur-Rahman
**Marjani Abdur-Rahman** is a jack of all trades who is dedicated to finding purpose in an ever changing world. She studies health, human services, and social work at the University of Michigan Dearborn. Marjani embraces each moment as a singer, actress, motivational speaker, mixed media artist, licensed nail technician, and more. She wishes to tell everyone that if she can do it, so can you and that anything is capable with determination and self-love. As someone dedicated to finding a path on a darkened road, Marjani is a source of vibrant light, who uses art in a wide range of capacities to deliver her message of profound representations through her own built experiences. She is dedicated to fight for the betterment of her own identity and others surrounding her, a defining feature found in all of her art
