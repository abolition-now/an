# A study guide: jackie sumell
**jackie sumell** is a multidisciplinary artist and abolitionist based in New Orleans, LA. Her work has been anchored at the intersection of activism, education, and art for nearly two decades. sumell’s collaboration with Herman Wallace (a prisoner-of-consciousness and member of the Angola 3) was the subject of the Emmy Award-Winning documentary Herman’s House. Her work with Herman has positioned herself at the forefront of the national campaign to end solitary confinement and seek humane alternatives to incarceration. She continues to work on Herman’s House, Solitary Gardens, The Prisoner’s Apothecary, and several other community-generated, advocacy-based projects, maintaining her commitment to those directly impacted by mass incarceration through both art and advocacy.

### Quote
“The art critic would tell you I am a ‘social sculptor’; my calloused hands would tell you that is not a complete story. I build. For nearly two decades, I have rebuilt isolation cells based on drawings from prisoners I work intimately with. I bring their drawings to life through wood, metal, and organic materials. My work has required some fabrication, but the most fulfilling legacy is generated by relationships.”
