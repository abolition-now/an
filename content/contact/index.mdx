# Contact

Any contributor may request the complete removal of their art, all representations of their work, and any related data at any time. We ensure requests are honored promptly and without friction. In doing so, we consciously steer away from the extractive and often violent legacy of traditional archives, which historically served to surveil and simultaneously exclude the communities they claim to represent.

**Contact us**:

**Follow us on instagram**:

Abolition Now works in partnership with <a href="https://transformativenow.org">Transformative Now</a>, an international
community of people working to build visual literacy through localized art making initiatives that support artists and
strengthen cooperation and social engagement.
