## About Abolition Now

**Abolition Now** (**AN**) is a digitally curated, searchable open-source web platform documenting an unprecedented flow
of social movement and political art in the era of “new abolition,” spanning from the birth of the Movement for Black
Lives, through the George Floyd uprisings, and into the present. These images trouble the foundational ideological
relationships between crime and punishment by creating political art directed against punishment and carceral systems,
and toward new social relations and worlds. Vetted collectively by artists, organizers, and activist scholars, AN is an
archive from below, engaging the art and the artists who are directly impacted by the carceral system and its attendant
structural inequities. Against the archival and media disappearance of this work historically, we provide access points
to their work, their voices (interviews), and their study (guides and commentaries). Every time you arrive at the
portals of this digital world, you will encounter abolition as its images exist now, which is to say past in present,
prefiguring the future, on the move.
