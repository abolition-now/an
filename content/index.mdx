**Abolition Now** (**AN**) is a digitally curated, searchable open-source web platform documenting an unprecedented flow of
social movement and political art in the era of “new abolition,” spanning from the birth of the Movement for Black
Lives, through the George Floyd uprisings, and into the present. These images trouble the foundational ideological
relationships between crime and punishment by creating political art directed against punishment and carceral systems,
and toward new social relations and worlds.

Vetted collectively by artists, organizers, and activist scholars, AN is an archive from below, engaging the art and
the artists who are directly impacted by or speaking back to carceral systems. Against the disappearance of this work
in official archives and mainstream media, we provide access points to the images, the voices (interviews), and the
study (guides) of historic struggles. We trace, when possible, how and why these images were created, and how they have
been used and re-purposed, pointing to the span of their reach. AN is also a space to explore the visceral disgust and
anger with carceral systems as well as the beauty in the visions, tensions, and challenges of world-building. Every
time you arrive at the portals of this digital world, you will encounter abolition as its images exist now, which is
to say past in present, prefiguring the future, on the move.

We invite you to join us in collective growth by contributing your images, your knowledge about these and related
images, your art, your voices.
